      <h3>Validators</h3>
      <p>
        All code should be validated! HTML and CSS are not compiled which means
        that we need to manually validate our code. Just because code shows up
        in a browser <strong>does not mean it is correct</strong>!
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily there are free validators from w3c!
      </p>
      <p>
        I will use these validators to check your code! Hence, you can discover your errors 
        and should fix your errors before submitting.<br>
        "info" and "warnings" are issues that 
        do not need to be fixed, but you should understand what they mean. "errors" 
        need to be fixed. The number of "errors" found does not likely indicate
        the actual number of errors. A small, single mistake can cause many errors or vice versa.

inline-block --> This shows you how to create your list horinzinally if you don't want it vertically.

style
{marign: 
padding:
} 

You need to inspect your website, hover over shit and then you can cahnge stuff in your browser

li a hover {
  background-color: #111
}

NAV bar is jsut like a color, it has a number and if you plug that number in it will work. 

<!-- div class "menus=toggle" number goes here
 -->

 The most important shit should be in the middle, maybe that's why your webiste is messed up,

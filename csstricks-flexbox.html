    <h1>CSS Flexbox</h1>
    <p>Layout in websites has always been a challenge. Developers
      struggling to get things to display where they wanted misused
      html elements such as to help with
      their layout challenges. DON'T USE TABLES FOR LAYOUT!<br>
      Luckily, today we have specific css tools to help with those
      layout challengs - flexbox and css grid.</p>
    <p>Often flexbox and css grid are viewed as interchangeable. 
      However, I think that is wrong. Flexbox is made for smaller, simpler
      pages or sections of a complicated page. CSS Grid is for a 
      large layout. Maybe a good illustration would be flexbox could be used 
      inside a page using CSS Grid but it would be weird if reversed.</p>

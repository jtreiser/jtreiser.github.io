<!-- HTML basics -->

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

<!-- Example of this -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> -->

HTML headings 

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<!-- Link tags -->
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag: 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a> 

Images 

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes: 
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"> 

The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a> 

    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
    <img src="img_girl.jpg">

    The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

Example
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

Example
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

Example
Set the background color for a page to powderblue:

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>


<body>

    <h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    </body>
    
    The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

    Example
    <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>
    
    
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>



The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>

Formatting Text 
<b> - Bold text
    <strong> - Important text
    <i> - Italic text
    <em> - Emphasized text
    <mark> - Marked text
    <small> - Smaller text
    <del> - Deleted text
    <ins> - Inserted text
    <sub> - Subscript text
    <sup> - Superscript text

        <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>

<p style="color:#ffff
">This is a paragraph.</p>

What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, 
how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are 
to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!


External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

"styles.css":
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}

<!-- The CSS border property defines a border around 
an HTML element. -->

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all
HTML elements.

<!-- The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border. -->

Example
Use of CSS border and padding properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
}

<!-- The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border. -->

Example
Use of CSS border and margin properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}
